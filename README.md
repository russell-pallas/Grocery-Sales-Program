# Grocery-Sales-Program
This program allows you to analyze sales data from an input file.

You will be able to choose from multiple options including:
  1. All items sold and the number of times each item was sold
  2. Select individual items to see and how many times that item was sold
  3. See a visual representation (histogram) for all items sold and their sale frequency. Similar to option 1 but with a visualization rather than numbers. 
  4. Quit program

This program is written in C++ and Python. Python functions were called from the C++ main class. 


I feel as though I did a good job of keeping the CPP code simple. It is somewhat important to keep your
main class as clean as possible. If someone needs to run through your code and wants to see the execution
steps, a clean and easy to follow main class greatly facilitates that process. 

I believe that my code could be enhanced by implementing a better UI as well as looping thorugh back to
the menu display after a user has made a selection and seen the data they need to. 

I wouldn't necessarily say that any part of the code was more difficult to wrtie than another, however, 
there were times where I found myself going online to see how to implement an idea in Python. Also, 
it took some adjusting implementing the Python and realizing that the list doesn't permanently exist.
When I stepped back and looked at it though, I remembered that coding is just telling a computer
what to do and that certainly helped me to realize what I needed to do. 

The greatest thing that I have learned that I will be able to use in another project is the integration
of other languages within a project. Also, realizing that sometimes it can be useful to create a 
file with the data that the user wanted can also be transferred to other projects. 

This project is easily maintainable given the file names, inline comments, as well as the fact that it
is written in Python and C++ which are both fairly universal languages and easily adapted.
