# Grocery-Sales-Program
This program allows you to analyze sales data from an input file.

You will be able to choose from multiple options including:
  1. All items sold and the number of times each item was sold
  2. Select individual items to see and how many times that item was sold
  3. See a visual representation (histogram) for all items sold and their sale frequency. Similar to option 1 but with a visualization rather than numbers. 
  4. Quit program

This program is written in C++ and Python. Python functions were called from the C++ main class.
